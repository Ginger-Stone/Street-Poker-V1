    <p><h3>Normal Cards</h3> 4,5,6,7,9,10</p>
    <p>Normal cards don't have a lot of rules pertaining them. You only need to place cards having either the same number or suits (clubs, hearts, spades, diamonds). For example</p>

    <img src="images/PNG/4S.png" class="images" alt="Spades card">
    <p><h3>special Cards</h3> A,2,3,8,J,Q,K</p>
    <p>For special Cards, there are several rules that apply for the different cards</p>
    <h4>A(Ace)</h4>
    <p>"A" can be placed at anytime of the game as ong as it's your turn and thus can be used to change the game from one suit to anther. ie from clubs to diamond</p>
    <img src="images/PNG/AH.png" class="images" alt="Hearts card">
    <img src="images/PNG/AD.png" class="images" alt="Hearts card">
    <img src="images/PNG/AC.png" class="images" alt="Hearts card">
    <p>"A" spades a.k.a "A" special is considered more special as it can be used to demand for both suit and number unlike the other three which only demand for the suit</p>
    <img src="images/PNG/AS.png" class="images" alt="Hearts card">
    <h4>2 and 3</h4>
    <p>When a player places a "2" or a "3", the next player is allowed to place a "2" or "3" respectively or collect "2" or "3" cards respectively. The layer can also cancel cancel collection if they have "A"</p>
    <img src="images/PNG/3S.png" class="images" alt="Hearts card">
    <img src="images/PNG/2D.png" class="images" alt="Hearts card">
    <h4>8 and Q(Queen a.k.a Question)</h4>
    <p>These two cards are considered questions and thus placing them require you to add an extra card as an answer. The answer should not be a special card. The answer should match the suit of the question or can be "A". If you have no answer, then you are required to collect a card</p>
